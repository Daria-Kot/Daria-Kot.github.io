We designed a fast autonomous car and explored dynamic behaviors, acting forces, sensors, and reactive control on an embedded processor, as well as the benefit of partial off-board computation, low latency software, and noise tolerant implementation.\nCheck out my website here\nHighlights\n","path":null},{"url":"https://daria-kot.github.io/","title":"About Me","description":null,"body":"Daria Kot\nAbout Me\n\nHi, I'm Daria! I'm currently a computer science student at Cornell University, graduating in Spring 2025.\nI’m passionate about embedded software and robotics-basically anthying that brings hardware and software together to solve cool problems! As a part of the Cornell Rocketry Student Engineering Project Team, I’ve worked on exciting pojects that pushed me to think creatively and work closely with an amazing team. I love learning, building and tackling challenges in a team setting! I’m excited to see where ths journey in robotics and aerospace takes me!\n\n\nPlease explore my page and check out the portfolio section to see what cool projects I’ve worked on!\n","path":null},{"url":"https://daria-kot.github.io/resume/","title":"My Resume","description":null,"body":"\n\nDownload My Resume\n\n\n","path":null},{"url":"https://daria-kot.github.io/contact/","title":"","description":null,"body":"Contact Me\n\nI’d love to hear from you!
