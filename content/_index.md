## About Me
<img src="/files/Daria.jpg#no-hover#start" alt="Picture of Daria" style="display:block;">
Hi, I'm Daria! I'm currently a Computer Science student at Cornell University, graduating in Spring 2025.

I'm passionate about embedded software and robotics -- essentially anything that combines hardware and software to solve exciting challenges! As a part of the Cornell Rocketry Student Engineering Project Team, I've worked on projects that pushed me to think creatively and collaborate closely with an amazing team. My contributions include the development of electronics and software for the Break Line Manipulation System (BLiMs), a remote actuator, and a sensor board. I've also integrated and tuned a PID controller for a camera stabilization payload and facilitated the design, manufacturing, and integration of an L3 rocket! These experiences have deepened my technical expertise and strengthened my passion for solving complex problems.

Please explore my page and check out the portfolio section to see some of the exciting projects I've worked on!
