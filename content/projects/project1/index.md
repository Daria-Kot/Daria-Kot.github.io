## Current Role
As the Recovery and Payload Sub-team Lead, I’m guiding a dynamic group of engineers in designing, manufacturing, and testing cutting-edge systems for our high-powered rocket. These include an autonomous recovery system and an air-sampling payload that leverages onboard microfluidics to analyze dust particulates collected during flight. This rocket will compete in the annual Spaceport America Cup, the largest intercollegiate rocketry competition in the world.
### Highlights:

- Leading the integration of electronics, software, BLiMs, and motors into an L3 test rocket, which collects telemetry data to support the development of a BLiMs control system and validates our new single-event, two-stage recovery scheme.

- Collaborating with a multidisciplinary team of 50 members to ensure seamless integration across mechanical, electrical, and software systems.

- Driving recruitment efforts, including organizing information sessions, conducting interviews, and onboarding new members to build a skilled and passionate team.

- Managing project timelines, defining system requirements, and coordinating testing schedules to ensure successful execution of Recovery and Payload objectives.

## Break Line Manipulation System (BLiMs)
BLiMs is an intelligent recovery system designed to steer parachute break lines and guide the rocket’s descent. As a key developer, I worked on:

- Designing an electronic suite with sensors (altimeter, compass, IMU), motor drivers, and microcontrollers.

- Implementing a closed-loop PID control system to process telemetry data and control stepper motors for real-time adjustments.

- Testing the system in various conditions to ensure precision and reliability.

- This project combined advanced control algorithms with hands-on hardware development, pushing my understanding of embedded systems and aerodynamics.

## Peripheral Systems for Testing BLiMs
To support BLiMs development, I created several peripheral systems:

- Remote Actuator: A wireless system using microcontrollers and radio modules to simulate midair parachute inflation. It enabled precise testing of parachute separation and inflation dynamics.

- Sensor Board: Designed to collect and store telemetry data, this board included an altimeter, compass, IMU, GPS, and an SD card reader.
These tools were instrumental in validating the functionality and robustness of BLiMs in real-world scenarios.


## Camera Stabilization Payload
Stabilizing a camera in a rocket traveling at high speeds is no small feat! I integrated electronics and tuned a PID controller to ensure the camera remained oriented correctly, counteracting the roll of the rocket during flight.

## Competition Success

The culmination of these efforts led to 2nd place out of 160 teams at the 2022-2023 Spaceport America Cup, including a 1st place finish in the 10k Student Research and Development Category. These achievements reflect the incredible teamwork and innovation within Cornell Rocketry.
