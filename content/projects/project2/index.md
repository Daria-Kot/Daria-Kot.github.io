description = "This webpage documents the work I've done in ECE4160: Fast Robots. This course focused on systems level design and implementation of dynamic autonomous robots.  We designed a fast autonomous car and explored dynamic behaviors, acting forces, sensors, and reactive control on an embedded processor, as well as the benefit of partial off-board computation, low latency software, and noise tolerant implementation."

This course focused on systems level design and implementation of dynamic autonomous robots. We designed a fast autonomous car and explored dynamic behaviors, acting forces, sensors, and reactive control on an embedded processor, as well as the benefit of partial off-board computation, low latency software, and noise tolerant implementation.
